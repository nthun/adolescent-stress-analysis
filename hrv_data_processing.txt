Processing of the pulse data (photopletysmograph)

Data processing was done in R and using Artiifact (v 2.13) toolbox. 

1. Data was recorded at 2048 Hz.
2. Data was detrended using a moving average of 2048 sample (1 sec) window. (R)
3. Data was downsampled to 128 Hz. (R)
4. PPG peaks were detected automatically, using a global treshold and verified by manual inspection. (Artiifact)
5. Inter beat intervals (IBIs) were calculated based on the identified peaks. (Artiifact)
6. Files were cut using the markers for each event. (R)
7. Berntson algorithm was used to remove artifacts from the IBIs. Cubic spline interpolation was ued to correct the artifacts. (Artiifact 3.0 Beta)
8. Segments that had less than 30 samples were removed. (R)
9. Time and frequency domain HRV metrics were calculated on each segment (4 Hz interpolation rate, 30 sec window, 50% overlap). (Artiifact)
10. Outliers (RMSSD > +-3 SD) were removed. (R)
